In sales, marketing, or product, passion transforms everything. Sales becomes about deeply understanding the customer’s problem and offering the ideal solution. Marketing shifts to evangelizing a future yet to exist, making technology’s potential tangible and exciting. Building a product is like sculpting—you refine it to reveal its true form. Passion lets you see not just what it is, but what it could be, where market needs and tech possibilities meet.
The best in tech are driven by the possibilities it creates and the lives it improves. 

This is the passion I’ve found in myself.
